<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a computational concept that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Understanding time complexity is crucial for writing efficient algorithms that perform well even with large datasets.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is often expressed in terms of Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates that the space required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
